MissingOutputException in rule exact_er_cx in file /Users/fredericbusch/Desktop/Thesis/forks/py-raccoon/workflow/Snakefile, line 43:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/synthetic/er/nodes=20 p=0.2 r=0.5/cx/length=10 exact=True directed=True parallel=False/cx_0.csv (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
