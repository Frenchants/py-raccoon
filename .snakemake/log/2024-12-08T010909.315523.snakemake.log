MissingOutputException in rule dataset_cx in file /Users/fredericbusch/Desktop/Thesis/forks/py-raccoon/workflow/Snakefile, line 116:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/real/epinions/null_model=False/cx/e=False p=False l=10 s=1/run/cx_0.csv (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
